# ECG-Heart-Beat-Classification
This is the Final Project for the Pattern Recognition &amp; Classification Course at Stevens Institute of Technology. Different machine learning models were built such as Random Forest, XGBoost Classifier &amp; Neural Network Models to detect unusual ECG Signal patterns that indicate Arrhythmia.
